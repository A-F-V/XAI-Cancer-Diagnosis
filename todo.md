### With respect to dissertation

- [x] Move GCN part out of preperation
- [x] Delete project managemet part
- [x] Delete part on average colour in graph definition
- [ ] Add photo of graph visualized
- [x] Rewrite section on GCN
  - [x] Talk about GCN and how it works
  - [x] Talk about use of mean and max global pooling with reference to the GIN paper
  - [x] Talk about additional transformations
  - [x] Keep stuff about regularization and talk about how constraining model width
  - [x] Graph Augmentations
  - [x] Recall 4 possible classes - MAKE CLEAR
- [ ] Write section on GCExplainer
  - [x] What are concepts
  - [x] Suggest model implicitly discovers concepts and uses them
  - [x] Clustering as a tool of concept discovery
    - [ ] What is clustering
    - [ ] K-Means
  - [x] How are concepts discovered?
    - [x] Clustering on final node activations. Hypothesis is that the latent representation is the embedding for that concept.
    - [x] TSNE of node-embeddings conceptualized
  - [x] Concepts should span training set
  - [x] Concepts can be used as indicators
    - [ ] Conditional probability distribution
    - [ ] P(class|concept)
    - [ ] Many concepts in a graph, some support and some are contradictions of prediction
  - [ ] Want to extract the supporting evidence from the graph
    - [ ] Can point towards the presence "concept X & Y" as reasons / explanations for the model predicting
  - [ ] Need to give interpretation for concepts. What does concept 2 mean?
    - [ ] Needs expert to translate, but can give examples
    - [ ] Algorithm for getting examples
    - [ ] Examples can be visually depicted
  - [ ] How are these explanations conveyed to the user?
    - [ ] By highlighting the regions exhibiting the most supporting concepts and giving other examples of such a concept.
- [ ] Write Evaluation of GCN
  - [ ] Compare to competition results
  - [ ] Comment on marginal improvement for canc_acc - confusion matrix weird
  - [ ] Evaluate why GIN and TopK were not used as per paper
  - [ ] Suggest with hyper parameter tuning, this could be definitly improved.
  - [ ] Remind tha only 300 examples for 4 classes are used
  - [ ] Also suggest augmentation of node embedding
- [ ] Write evaluation of GCExplainer
  - [ ] How was k chosen
  - [ ] Concept completeness score
    - [ ] Quote
    - [ ] Challenge of overfitting (as k tends to number of nodes in graph, concept completeness tends to 1)
    - [ ] Propose use of concept prevelance:
      - [ ] The percentage of graphs the least n% occuring concepts feature in
  - [ ] Concept purity
    - [ ] How close concepts are to the centroid
  - [ ] Compare to GCExplainer results
    - [ ] New paper
    - [ ] Real world sets were predicted to perform less well
- [ ] Write Conclusion:
  - [ ] Results:
    - [ ] Decent implementations that, with further tuning, would perform around existing models
    - [ ] Applied GCExplainer to a new problem and explored its strengths and weaknesses
  - [ ] Impact:
    - [ ] Universality of approach - not specific to breast cancer but can in theory by trained on other tissues
  - [ ] Lessons Learnt:
    - [ ] The reward and Challenge with working with real world data
    - [ ] Working at intersection of discplines
  - [ ] Future Work:
    - [ ] Modularity of steps and improvement of each
    - [ ] Combine Neural and symbolic reasoning for explanations
  - [ ]
- [ ] Repository Tree with line count
- [ ] Pipeline diagram overview
  - [x] Diagram
  - [ ] Example
- [ ] Add Pietro's suggestions
  - [ ] Put in introduction picture of cellular network
