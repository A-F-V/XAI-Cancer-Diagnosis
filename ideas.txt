- rotation invariant convolution
- long distance connections in HoVerNet
- copy and paste augmentation for challenging cancer cases

- Using e-LRP or equivalent to figure out contribution of pixels in original node
    - then map these contributions back onto original image

- use convolutions instead of MLP in PNA

- use 1/DISTANCE**2 as edge weight

- Siamese network
- No Softmax
